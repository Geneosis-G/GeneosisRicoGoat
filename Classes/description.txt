[b]EASTER EGGS[/b]
- [spoiler]Grapple the floor while your parachute is open to gain altitude.[/spoiler]

- [spoiler]There is a secret key to remove both tethers and mines limits ;)[/spoiler]

[b]KNOWN BUGS[/b]
- Sometimes trying to open the parachute after using wingsuit won't work. Land to fix.
- The grappling rope might not be correcltly attached to both ends, visual bug only, the logic behind is fine.
- Mines might sometimes stick with weird angle or weird position (inside object, or flying near it).
- The game may start to have random lag spikes after using too many tethers. Restart map to fix.

[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]I'm not sure if this was an actual request or just something I really wanted to do, anyway I had a lot of fun making it and testing it ^^ If you are not familiar with it, this mod is a huge reference to the Just Cause game series (partcularly JC3). Most of the abilities gathered here are improved versions of existing mutators, but I thought the improvements were worth making an entire mod for them :p
The first element I worked on was the parachute. Taken from GoatZ, I did repaint it in black and removed the parachute drop when you close it (this was annoying and a potential lag source). Then I added some combines abilites with the hook to mimic as much as possible the JC3 behaviour like the fact the you will gain altitude when you grapple to the ground.
Then came the wingsuit :D This part is actually 100% new, I used the hangglider model as little wings and coded from scratch a simplified "wingsuit-like" flight behaviour. I also enforced the camera to follow the goat in order to match a bit more the "plane mode" view used in JC3 for wingsuit flight.
The grappling hook is actually two separate things: the first one is what you get from Uncle Goat that will drag your goat to a specific location, and the second one is from Tether Goat (Waste of Space) to link two items together. For the grapple part I didn't change many thing of it's behaviour, I only added a rope model instead of the tongue and linked it to the tool on the goat back. I also enforced hovering when you try to drag yourself to a far point, because the default grapling hook would just drag you on a few meters and stop as soon as you hit the floor :/
About tethers, the original electric link have been replaced by the rope, the mechanism have been extended to accept attachment on almost any surface (this was quite hard and took a lot of time to tweak it correclty).
Finally the sticky mines are modified Limb Ragdoller (Payday) sringes :p I kept the sticky ability and improved it to stick better on moving objects and large surfaces, and I added the explosive behavoir ^^
